Problem Description
    Given the head of a singly linked list, write a function to reverse the linked list.The function should return the new head of the reversed linked list.

Input Format:
    The input consists of two lines:
    The first line contains an integer n, the number of nodes in the linked list.
    The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the values of the nodes in the linked list.

Examples

    Example 1:
    Input:
        5
        1 2 3 4 5
    Output:
        5 4 3 2 1
    Explanation:The original linked list is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5. After reversing, it becomes 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1.

    Example 2:
    Input:
        3
        10 20 30
    Output:
        30 20 10
    Explanation:The original linked list 10 → 20 → 30 is reversed to 30 → 20 → 10.

    Example 3:
    Input:
        1
        42
    Output:
        42
    Explanation:A single-node linked list remains unchanged after reversal.

Constraints:
    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10⁴].
    -10⁵ ≤ Node.val ≤ 10⁵.
