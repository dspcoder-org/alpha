### Problem Description
    Given the head of a singly linked list, write a function to check if the linked list represents a palindrome. 
    A linked list is a palindrome if the sequence of values reads the same forward and backward.

### Input format:
    The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n, the number of nodes in the linked list. 
    The second line contains n space-separated integers, the values of the nodes in the linked list.

### Examples

    Example 1:
    Input: 
        5
        1 2 3 2 1
    Output: true
    Explanation: The linked list reads the same forward and backward, making it a palindrome.
    
    Example 2:
    Input:
        4
        1 2 2 1
    Output: true
    Explanation: The linked list is a palindrome as it is symmetric.
    
    Example 3:
    Input: 
        3
        1 2 3
    Output: false
    Explanation: The linked list is not a palindrome because 1 ≠ 3.

### Constraints
    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10⁴].
    -10⁵ ≤ Node.val ≤ 10⁵.
