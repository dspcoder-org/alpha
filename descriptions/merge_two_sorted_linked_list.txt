Problem Description
    Given two sorted linked lists, write a function to merge them into a single sorted linked list.
    The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
    Input format:
    The input consists of two lines. The first two lines contain space-separated integers representing
    the values of nodes in the first and second sorted linked lists, respectively. 

Examples
    Example 1:
    Input:
        1 2 4
        1 3 4
    Output:
        1 1 2 3 4 4
    Explanation: Merge the two sorted lists by comparing and ordering the nodes.

    Example 2:
    Input:
        0 3 6
        1 2 5
    Output: 
        0 1 2 3 5 6
    Explanation: Merge the two sorted lists maintaining the sorted order.

    Example 3:
    Input:
        []
        0 1 2
    Output: 
        0 1 2
    Explanation: If one list is empty, return the other list.

Constraints
The number of nodes in each list is in the range [0, 50].
-10⁵ ≤ Node.val ≤ 10⁵
Both input lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
